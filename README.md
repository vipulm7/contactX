## About
#### Fed up of seeing never-ending list of irrelevant contacts in every app you use? 
Introducing ContactX, the ultimate app for keeping your contacts separate from your stock phonebook and out of reach of other apps!

## Why?
Do you ever save a contact just for the purpose of retaining its number, but don't want it to appear in your daily feed? If so, you're not by yourself.

That's where ContactX comes in - it lets you save these non-important contacts without adding them to your daily feed. Also, you can
- call
- **get notified about who's calling**
- sms
- send WhatsApp and Telegram texts

all of these, without the contact being added to your stock phonebook.

## User's Privacy
### Your data is your data
ContactX prioritizes your privacy above everything else! To ensure this, ContactX uses Android's ROOM database to store all your data on your device locally. This implies that your data never leaves your phone, and all your contacts remain entirely secured and protected.\
You may refer to [Privacy Policy](/PrivacyPolicy.md) and [Limited Use Policy](/LimitedUsePolicy.md).

## Enhanced User Functionality
If you choose to disable the Google People and Drive APIs, you won't be able to use certain features such as backing up and restoring your database to your Google Drive, importing contacts from your Google account directly into the app, or adding and deleting contacts from within the app.\
However, if you opt-in to these APIs, you can enjoy these enhanced user functionalities with ease.\
While it is possible to achieve the same results using alternative methods, enabling these APIs would simplify the process.
